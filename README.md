# leetcode-by-vithula

▹ This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.

▹ I primarily solve problems using Python, and I am actively learning Java and C. 

▹ The purpose of this repository is to document my problem-solving process, track progress, and develop proficiency across multiple programming languages. 

▹ I aim to practice and solve at least one LeetCode problem per day to maintain consistency and improve steadily over time.
